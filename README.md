# diaryMe
This project is my attempt to develop a simple diary app page in iOS. The purpose of the app are uploading their diary entry  and retrieving them from the database. This is an alternative solution for the user instead of the traditional diary method, because it prevents the user from losing their diary entries and provides enhance experience in writing diary. Â 

All of the data created by the app will be updated to Firebase in the text format. In the future, the data format will be extended to image and video type; the authentication function also included in. The app will use the Cocoa Pod framework with Firebase API, and it is well-designed in the MVC Structure.

First screen of the application is used to displayed all of the diary entry in Tableview format from Firebase database. The second screen is used to add diary entry from the phone to the Frebase database. To understand my code, you can read my comment which is appeared in every class and in every method.
