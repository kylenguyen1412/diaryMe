# diaryMe
This project is my attempt to develop a simple diary app page in iOS. The purpose of the app is that the users can upload their diary entry to Firebase cloud and also displaying the entries in the app. This is an alternative solution for the user instead of the traditional diary and note, because it prevent the user from losing their diary entries. Â 

All of the data created by the app will be updated to Firebase in the text format. In the future, the data format will be extended to image and video type; the authentication function also included in. The app will use the Cocoa Pod framework, and it is well-designed in the MVC Structure.

First screen of the application is used to displayed all of the diary entry in Tableview format from Firebase database. The second screen is used to add diary entry from the phone to the FIrebase database. To understand my code, you can read my comment which is appeared in every class and in every method.
